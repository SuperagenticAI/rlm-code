**RLM Code** is the definitive research operating system for building, running, evaluating, comparing, and optimizing LLM-based coding agents. It supports multiple agent paradigms including **Pure RLM**, **CodeAct**, and **Traditional** in a single unified platform with built-in safety, observability, and reproducibility.

## 🎯 What RLM Code Solves

The underlying long-context reasoning problem is what **RLM (the method)** addresses.
**RLM Code** addresses the tooling and workflow problem around using that method in practice.

Core product problems it targets:

- **Implementation friction**: provide a runnable RLM environment (`llm_query`, REPL, run loop) without custom scaffolding.
- **Experiment management**: run, replay, compare, and benchmark experiments in one place.
- **Safety controls**: route execution through secure backends and explicit runtime settings.
- **Reproducibility**: store traces, metrics, and benchmark artifacts for repeatable research.
- **Operational visibility**: expose observability, status, and diagnostics for debugging experiments.

In short, RLM Code is a research tooling layer for building and evaluating RLM-style workflows.

## 🚀 Quick Start

<div class="rlm-quickstart" markdown>

**Install and launch**

```bash
uv tool install "rlm-code[tui,llm-all]"
rlm-code
```

**Connect to a model**

```text
/connect anthropic claude-opus-4-6
```

**Run your first benchmark**

```text
/rlm bench preset=dspy_quick
```

**Keep runs bounded**

```text
/rlm run "small scoped task" steps=4 timeout=30 budget=60
/rlm abort all
```

**Compare benchmark output**

```text
/rlm bench compare candidate=latest baseline=previous
```

**Switch to the Research tab**

Press `Ctrl+5` or `F6` to open the **Research** tab to see your run's dashboard, trajectory, reward curves, and live events.
