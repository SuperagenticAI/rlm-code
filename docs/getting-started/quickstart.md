# ⚡ Quick Start

This guide walks you through launching RLM Code, connecting to an LLM, running your first benchmark, viewing the leaderboard, and exploring the Research tab, all in under 10 minutes.

---

## ✅ Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- [x] 🐍 Python 3.10+ installed
- [x] 📦 RLM Code installed (`pip install rlm-code[tui,llm-all]`)
- [x] 🔑 At least one LLM API key (OpenAI, Anthropic, or Gemini) or a local Ollama instance

!!! tip "🏠 Local Models"
    You can use RLM Code entirely with local models via [Ollama](https://ollama.com/). No API keys needed:

    ```bash
    ollama pull llama3.2
    ```

---

## Step 1: 🚀 Launch the TUI

Navigate to a project directory (not your home directory) and launch:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/projects/rlm-demo && cd ~/projects/rlm-demo
rlm-code
```

!!! warning "⚠️ Directory Safety Check"
    RLM Code performs a safety check on startup. It will warn you if you are running from your home directory, Desktop, Documents, or a system directory. Always run from a dedicated project directory.

You should see the **RLM Research Lab** TUI with 5 tabs: 💬 Chat, 📁 Files, 📋 Details, ⚡ Shell, and 🔬 Research. The Chat tab is active by default.

---

## Step 2: 📁 Initialize Your Project

Initialize a project configuration file:

```
/init
```

This creates an `rlm_config.yaml` in your current directory with default settings. The initializer scans your project for existing files and frameworks.

---

## Step 3: 🔗 Connect to a Model

Use the `/connect` command to connect to an LLM provider:

=== "Anthropic (Claude)"

    ```
    /connect anthropic claude-sonnet-4-20250514
    ```

    !!! note
        Requires `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in your environment or `.env` file.

=== "OpenAI (GPT-4o)"

    ```
    /connect openai gpt-4o
    ```

    !!! note
        Requires `OPENAI_API_KEY` in your environment or `.env` file.

=== "Gemini"

    ```
    /connect gemini gemini-2.0-flash
    ```

    !!! note
        Requires `GEMINI_API_KEY` or `GOOGLE_API_KEY` in your environment or `.env` file.

=== "Ollama (Local)"

    ```
    /connect ollama llama3.2
    ```

    !!! note
        Requires a running Ollama server at `http://localhost:11434`.

### Interactive Model Picker

For an interactive keyboard-driven model selection experience:

```
/model
```

This presents a guided picker that lets you choose provider and model interactively.

### Verify Connection

Check that your model is connected:

```
/status
```

This shows the current model, provider, connection status, sandbox runtime, and observability sinks.

---

## Step 4: 🏆 Run a Benchmark

RLM Code ships with 10+ built-in benchmark presets. Start with the quick DSPy smoke test:

```
/rlm bench preset=dspy_quick
```

This runs 3 benchmark cases (Build Signature, Build Module, Add Tests) through the RLM loop: **context -> action proposal -> sandbox execution -> observation -> reward -> memory update**.

### List Available Presets

```
/rlm bench list
```

Available built-in presets:

| Preset | Cases | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `dspy_quick` | 3 | Fast DSPy coding loop smoke test |
| `dspy_extended` | 5 | Broader DSPy coding loop sweep |
| `generic_smoke` | 2 | Generic environment safety/sanity checks |
| `pure_rlm_smoke` | 3 | Pure RLM paper-compliant mode smoke test |
| `pure_rlm_context` | 4 | Pure RLM context-as-variable paradigm tests |
| `deep_recursion` | 3 | Deep recursion tests (depth > 1) |
| `paradigm_comparison` | 3 | Side-by-side paradigm comparison benchmarks |
| `oolong_style` | 4 | OOLONG-style long context benchmarks |
| `browsecomp_style` | 3 | BrowseComp-Plus style web reasoning benchmarks |
| `token_efficiency` | 3 | Token efficiency comparison benchmarks |

### Run a Pure RLM Benchmark

The Pure RLM benchmarks exercise the paper's core paradigm:

```
/rlm bench preset=pure_rlm_smoke
```

These tests use `context` as a REPL variable, `llm_query()` for recursive LLM calls, `FINAL()` and `FINAL_VAR()` for termination, and `SHOW_VARS()` for state inspection.

### Load External Benchmark Packs

You can load benchmarks from YAML, JSON, or JSONL files:

```
/rlm bench pack=my_benchmarks.yaml
```

Supported formats include explicit preset mappings, Pydantic-style dataset cases, Google ADK eval sets, and generic record datasets.

---

## Step 5: 📊 View the Leaderboard

After running benchmarks, view aggregated results on the leaderboard:

```
/leaderboard
```

The leaderboard displays a Rich table ranked by reward, showing:

- Entry ID
- Environment
- Model
- Average Reward
- Completion Rate
- Steps
- Tokens
- Efficiency (reward per 1000 tokens)

### Leaderboard Options

```
/leaderboard metric=completion_rate limit=20
/leaderboard metric=efficiency
/leaderboard metric=tokens
```

Available ranking metrics: `reward`, `completion_rate`, `steps`, `tokens`, `cost`, `duration`, `efficiency`.

---

## Step 6: 🔀 Compare Paradigms

Run the same task through multiple paradigms and compare:

```
/rlm bench preset=paradigm_comparison
```

This runs document summarization, information extraction, and multi-hop reasoning tasks through Pure RLM, CodeAct, and Traditional paradigms side by side.

Use the comparison command for direct A/B analysis:

```
/rlm bench compare preset=paradigm_comparison
```

---

## Step 7: ⏪ Session Replay

Every RLM run generates a trajectory that can be replayed step by step.

### Load a Session for Replay

```
/rlm replay
```

This loads the most recent run and enters replay mode with forward/backward navigation:

- **Step forward**: View the next action, observation, and reward
- **Step backward**: Go back to a previous state
- **Jump to step**: Go directly to any step number
- **Find errors**: Jump to steps that produced errors
- **View summary**: See session-level statistics

### Replay from a Specific File

```
/rlm replay path=.rlm_code/rlm/runs/run_abc12345.jsonl
```

Session replay supports both JSONL trajectory files and JSON snapshot files.

---

## Step 8: ⌨️ Explore Slash Commands

RLM Code has 50+ slash commands. Here are the most useful ones to explore next:

### RLM Commands

```
/rlm run "Analyze this code and suggest improvements"
/rlm status
/rlm doctor
/rlm chat "What patterns does this codebase use?"
/rlm observability
```

### Sandbox Commands

```
/sandbox status
/sandbox doctor
/sandbox use docker
```

### File and Layout Commands

```
/snapshot          # Take a project snapshot
/diff              # Show file diffs
/view chat         # Switch to chat view
/layout multi      # Switch to multi-pane layout
/pane files show   # Show the files panel
/focus chat        # Focus the chat input
```

### Shell Access

```
/shell ls -la
!python --version
```

!!! tip "Shell Shortcut"
    Prefix any command with `!` to run it as a shell command directly:

    ```
    !pip list | grep dspy
    ```

### Get Help

```
/help
```

## 🔬 Step 9: Explore the Research Tab

After running a benchmark, press `Ctrl+5` to switch to the **🔬 Research** tab:

- **📊 Dashboard**: See run metrics, reward sparkline, and summary
- **📈 Trajectory**: Step-by-step breakdown of agent actions and rewards
- **🏆 Benchmarks**: Leaderboard table from all your runs
- **⏪ Replay**: Step-through controls for time-travel debugging
- **📡 Events**: Live event stream from the RLM event bus

!!! tip "🔬 Research Tab"
    The Research tab updates automatically when you run `/rlm bench` or `/rlm run` commands. No manual refresh needed!
