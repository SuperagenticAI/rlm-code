# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Planned:
  - **Plan / Code modes** in interactive CLI (explicit "planning" vs "coding" flows for complex tasks).
  - First‑class support for **open‑source models via third‑party providers** (e.g. OpenRouter, Groq and similar gateways), alongside existing Ollama + cloud integrations.

### Fixed
- TBC

## [0.1.3] - 2025-01-XX

### Fixed
- **Critical Bug Fix**: Fixed duplicate code generation issue where natural language requests triggered code generation twice, causing unnecessary LLM API calls, high CPU usage, and duplicate code blocks in output
- Removed duplicate code block in natural language processing path that was calling `_process_input()` twice for the same user input

---

## [0.1.2] - 2025-01-XX

### Added
- **MCP Integration**: Full Model Context Protocol (MCP) client support with commands for server management (`/mcp-servers`, `/mcp-connect`, `/mcp-disconnect`), tools (`/mcp-tools`, `/mcp-call`), resources (`/mcp-resources`, `/mcp-read`), and prompts (`/mcp-prompts`, `/mcp-prompt`)
- **MCP Documentation**: Complete MCP guides and tutorials (overview, integration reference, filesystem assistant, GitHub triage)
- **MCP Examples**: Working implementations for filesystem assistant and GitHub triage copilot, plus configuration examples
- **MCP Configuration**: Support for stdio, SSE, and WebSocket transports with multiple directory access for filesystem server
- **MCP Error Handling**: Auto-connect for `/mcp-tools`, detailed error messages with troubleshooting tips

### Changed
- **Default Performance Settings**: Fast mode now enabled by default, RAG disabled by default for faster initial responses
- `/mcp-tools` command now auto-connects to servers if not already connected
- Improved MCP error messages and session management
- Welcome screen displays performance settings (RAG/Fast Mode status) with contextual tips
- Code generation completion messages now include tips to enable RAG for better quality when disabled

### Fixed
- Fixed `/mcp-tools` command failing when server not connected
- Improved error handling for MCP connection and configuration issues

## [0.1.1] - 2025-11-27

### Added
- **UV Support**: Full support for `uv` as an alternative to `python -m venv` for creating virtual environments. Documentation updated to recommend `uv` as the primary method.
- **Performance Toggles**: New `/fast-mode [on|off]`, `/disable-rag`, and `/enable-rag` commands for controlling RAG indexing and response speed. Performance settings now visible in welcome screen and `/status` command.
- **Venv Detection**: Automatic detection of virtual environment in project root with startup warnings if missing.

### Changed
- Welcome screen now displays RAG Mode and Fast Mode status with context-aware tips.
- Code execution prefers Python from project's `.venv/bin/python` when available.
- Documentation updated to recommend `uv` as the primary installation method.

## [0.1.0] - 2025-11-26

### Added
- **Interactive CLI**: Rich TUI with natural language interface for generating DSPy Signatures, Modules, and Programs. Core workflows: development (`/init` → generate → `/validate` → `/run`) and optimization (`/data` → `/optimize` → `/eval`).
- **Model Support**: Local Ollama models and cloud providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini) with interactive `/model` command for easy connection. SDK support via optional extras: `rlm-code[openai]`, `rlm-code[anthropic]`, `rlm-code[gemini]`, `rlm-code[llm-all]`.
- **Code Generation**: Natural language to DSPy code with support for major patterns (ChainOfThought, ReAct, RAG, etc.) and templates for common use cases.
- **Validation & Execution**: `/validate` for code checks, `/run` and `/test` for sandboxed execution.
- **GEPA Optimization**: End-to-end optimization workflows with `/optimize` commands and evaluation metrics integration.
- **MCP Integration**: Built-in MCP client for connecting to external tools and data sources.
- **Project Management**: `/init`, codebase indexing, RAG support, session management, and export/import functionality.
- **Documentation**: Complete docs site (MkDocs Material) with getting started guides, tutorials, and reference documentation.

### Changed
- Default Ollama timeout increased to 120 seconds for large models.
- Examples updated to use modern models (`gpt-5-nano`, `claude-sonnet-4.5`, `gemini-2.5-flash`).
- Interactive UI improved with Rich library and `DSPY_CODE_SIMPLE_UI` mode for limited emoji support.
- Natural language routing refined to prefer answers for questions and avoid duplicate code generation.

### Fixed
- OpenAI SDK migration to new client API, removed unsupported parameters for newer models.
- Interactive mode errors (`name 'explanations' is not defined`, syntax errors).
- Ollama timeout handling and error messages.
- Documentation formatting and navigation issues.
